Program 10: File Handling in C++
Aim: To demonstrate file reading and writing operations using file streams in C++.

Algorithm:

Start the program.
Include the <fstream> header.
Declare ofstream object to write data to a file.
Declare ifstream object to read data from the file.
Write text into the file using ofstream.
Close the file.
Reopen it in read mode and display its contents.
Stop the program.
Source Code:

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream outFile("sample.txt");
    outFile << "Hello, this is a sample file.\n";
    outFile << "File handling in C++ is easy!";
    outFile.close();

    ifstream inFile("sample.txt");
    string line;
    cout << "Contents of file:\n";
    while (getline(inFile, line)) {
        cout << line << endl;
    }
    inFile.close();
    return 0;
}
Sample Output:

Contents of file:
Hello, this is a sample file.
File handling in C++ is easy!
Result: The program successfully demonstrates file handling operations in C++ using file streams.
