Program 2: Constructor and Destructor
Aim: To illustrate the use of constructors and destructors in C++.

Algorithm:

Start the program.
Define a class Student with data members name and age.
Define a constructor to initialize the data members.
Define a member function display() to show the details.
Define a destructor to display a message when an object is destroyed.
Create objects and call the display function.
Stop the program.
Source Code:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    Student(string n, int a) {
        name = n;
        age = a;
        cout << "Constructor called for " << name << endl;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
    }

    ~Student() {
        cout << "Destructor called for " << name << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1("John", 20);
    Student s2("Alice", 19);

    s1.display();
    s2.display();

    return 0;
}
Result:

Constructor called for John
Constructor called for Alice
Name: John, Age: 20
Name: Alice, Age: 19
Destructor called for Alice
Destructor called for John
