Program 6: Inheritance in C++
Aim: To demonstrate single inheritance in C++.

Algorithm:

Start the program.
Create a base class Person with data members name and age.
Create a derived class Student that inherits publicly from Person.
Add data member studentID in the derived class.
Define a member function to display all details.
Create an object of the derived class and display data.
Stop the program.
Source Code:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Person {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    void getDetails() {
        cout << "Enter Name: ";
        cin >> name;
        cout << "Enter Age: ";
        cin >> age;
    }
};

class Student : public Person {
public:
    int studentID;

    void getStudentDetails() {
        cout << "Enter Student ID: ";
        cin >> studentID;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "\nStudent Details:\n";
        cout << "Name: " << name << "\nAge: " << age << "\nStudent ID: " << studentID << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s;
    s.getDetails();
    s.getStudentDetails();
    s.display();
    return 0;
}
Sample Output:

Enter Name: John
Enter Age: 20
Enter Student ID: 101

Student Details:
Name: John
Age: 20
Student ID: 101
Result: The program successfully demonstrates single inheritance where the derived class inherits data and behavior from the base class.
