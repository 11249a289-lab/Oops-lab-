9(c) Member Function of Another Class as Friend
Aim: To demonstrate how a member function of one class can be declared as a friend in another class.

Algorithm:

Start the program.
Use forward declaration for the base class.
Define class GFG with a member function GFG_Function().
Declare this function as a friend inside the base class.
Define and use the function to access private and protected members.
Stop the program.
Source Code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base; // forward declaration

class GFG {
public:
    void GFG_Function(base &obj);
};

class base {
private:
    int private_variable;
protected:
    int protected_variable;

public:
    base() {
        private_variable = 10;
        protected_variable = 99;
    }
    friend void GFG::GFG_Function(base &);
};

void GFG::GFG_Function(base &obj) {
    cout << "Private Variable: " << obj.private_variable << endl;
    cout << "Protected Variable: " << obj.protected_variable << endl;
}

int main() {
    base b;
    GFG g;
    g.GFG_Function(b);
    return 0;
}
Result:

Private Variable: 10
Protected Variable: 99
