Experiment 28: Simple Graphics Program in C++


Aim

To write a simple graphics program in C++ to draw basic shapes (circle, line, rectangle) using the graphics.h library.

Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Include the header file <graphics.h> for graphics functions.
3. Initialize the graphics mode using initgraph().
4. Use graphics functions such as:
circle() → to draw a circle
line() → to draw a straight line
rectangle() → to draw a rectangle
5. Display the graphics output on the screen.
6. Use getch() to wait for a key press.
7. Close graphics mode using closegraph().
8. End the program.

Program: 

#include <graphics.h>
#include <conio.h>
int main() {
    int gd = DETECT, gm;
    // Initialize graphics mode
    initgraph(&gd, &gm, "C:\\Turboc3\\BGI");
    // Draw a circle
    circle(200, 150, 50);
    // Draw a rectangle
    rectangle(100, 200, 300, 250);
    // Draw a line
    line(100, 100, 300, 100);
    // Display message
    outtextxy(150, 300, "Simple Graphics Program in C++");
    getch();        // wait for user input
    closegraph();   // close graphics window
    return 0;
}

Output :

The graphics window shows:
A circle at position (200,150)
A horizontal line from (100,100) to (300,100)
A rectangle from (100,200) to (300,250)
A text message:
“Simple Graphics Program in C++”


Result

A simple graphics program in C++ using the BGI graphics library was successfully implemented.
Basic shapes such as circle, rectangle, and line were drawn, demonstrating the use of fundamental graphics functions.
