Program 1: Class and Objects Implementation
Aim: To illustrate the concept of Class and Objects in C++, and to implement member functions defined inside and outside the class.

Algorithm:

Start the program.
Define a class named Car with data members brand, model, and year.
Define a member function displayInfo() inside the class.
Declare a member function startEngine() inside the class and define it outside the class using the scope resolution operator.
Create two objects of the Car class: myCar and anotherCar.
Assign values to their data members.
Call the member functions displayInfo() and startEngine() for both objects.
Stop the program.
Source Code:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    string model;
    int year;

    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Model: " << model << ", Year: " << year << endl;
    }

    void startEngine();
};

void Car::startEngine() {
    cout << "The " << brand << " " << model << " engine is starting..." << endl;
}

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    Car anotherCar;

    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.model = "Camry";
    myCar.year = 2023;

    anotherCar.brand = "Honda";
    anotherCar.model = "Civic";
    anotherCar.year = 2022;

    myCar.displayInfo();
    myCar.startEngine();

    anotherCar.displayInfo();
    anotherCar.startEngine();

    return 0;
}
Result:

Brand: Toyota, Model: Camry, Year: 2023
The Toyota Camry engine is starting...
Brand: Honda, Model: Civic, Year: 2022
The Honda Civic engine is starting...
